# play-next-youtube
Have already decided which youtube which youtube video to watch next from the youtube suggestions? Just add it to the play next plugin.

This plugins adds a "Play Next" option to all videos on Youtube page of the current tab. Once added the video will start playing after the current video ( on the same tab ) has finished.

Enhancement would include 
- Adding multiple videos to play next.
- Multiple browser support ( Initally Firefox Quantum )
